It also offers other popular services—like Google Maps, YouTube, and Gmail. \nGoogle's search engine results pages (SERPs) are typically populated with various SERP features (like featured snippets, People Also Ask sections, and knowledge panels), based on the type of the search query. \nIn 2023, Google introduced its AI-powered search assistant called Bard. \nGoogle has faced many criticisms over the years. The most common are related to the amount of data it collects about its users. That's why privacy concerns are among the common reasons users seek Google alternatives.",
